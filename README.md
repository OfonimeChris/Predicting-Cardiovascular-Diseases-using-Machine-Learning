## Predicting-Cardiovascular-Diseases-using-Machine-Learning

This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) using patient health data.
## Project Overview
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally. Early prediction and intervention can significantly reduce mortality rates. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data, including medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements, to predict the likelihood of CVDs.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Doppala, B. P., & Bhattacharyya, D. (2021) and is available on Mendeley Data. It contains records of patients with cardiovascular disease-related data, with a total of 1000 records. The dataset includes 13 features, such as:
## Age
Gender
Blood Pressure
Cholesterol levels
Smoking habits
## Family history
The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features for better model performance. The features were also analyzed for any correlations, and feature engineering techniques were applied where necessary.
## Methodology
## The project follows these steps:
1.	Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
o	Loading and cleaning the dataset.
o	Handling missing values.
o	Encoding categorical features.
o	Scaling numerical features.
o	Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships.
2.	Feature Selection/Engineering (Optional):
o	Identifying important features using techniques like feature importance from tree-based models or statistical tests.
o	Creating new features from existing ones if necessary.
3.	Model Development:
o	Training various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
o	Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
o	Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
4.	Model Evaluation:
o	Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
o	Visualizing results using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
5.	Model Deployment (Optional):
